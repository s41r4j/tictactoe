## How to play

To start playing, you need to choose one of the available modes from the main menu:

- AI vs Player: In this mode, you can play against the computer with different difficulty levels. You can choose between easy or hard level depending on your skill and preference. You can also choose to play as X or O by tapping on the symbol you want. The computer will play as the other symbol and will make its moves automatically after you make yours. To make a move, simply tap on an empty square on the grid.
- Player vs Player: In this mode, you can play with another person on the same device. You need to take turns placing Xs and Os on the grid until one of you wins or the grid is full. The first player plays as X and the second player plays as O by default, but you can change this by tapping on the symbols before starting the game. To make a move, simply tap on an empty square on the grid.
- Online Multiplayer: In this mode, you can play with another person online over
the internet. You need an internet connection and a username to join or create a game room. You can chat with your opponent during
the game using text messages.

You can also customize your game by choosing one of
the available themes and colors from
the settings menu:

- Themes: You can choose between system theme (which matches your device's theme), light theme (which has a white background), or dark theme (which has a black background) for your game screen.
- Colors: You can choose between blue or green color for your symbols and
the grid lines.

To play multiplayer online mode,
follow these steps:

- Tap on Online Multiplayer mode on
the main menu.
- Enter your username in
the pop-up window and tap OK. Your username will be displayed to other players online.
- Choose to join an existing game room or create a new one by tapping on Join Room or Create Room buttons respectively.
- If you join an existing game room,
you will see a list of available rooms that other players have created. Each room has a code and a status (waiting or playing). Tap on
a room with waiting status to enter it. Wait for your opponent to start
the game.
- If you create a new game room,
you will see a code that identifies your room. You can share this code with your friend who wants to play with you online. Your friend needs to enter this code in their device to join your room. You can start
the game when both of you are ready by tapping on Start Game button.
- During
the game,
you can chat with your opponent by tapping on
the chat icon at
the bottom right corner of
the screen. A chat window will open where you can type and send messages.
