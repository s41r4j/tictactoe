## How to play 

> To start playing, you need to choose one of the available modes from the main menu:

### AI vs Player: 
- In this mode, you can play against the computer with different difficulty levels. You can choose between easy or hard level depending on your skill and preference. The computer will make its moves automatically after you make yours. To make a move, simply tap on an empty square on the grid.

### Player vs Player: 
- In this mode, you can play with another person on the same device. You need to take turns placing Xs and Os on the grid until one of you wins or the grid is full. The first player plays as X and the second player plays as O . To make a move, simply tap on an empty square on the grid.

### Online Multiplayer: 
- In this mode, you can play with another person online over the internet. You need an internet connection and a username to join or create a game room.
